        “Are you sure you’ll be okay? It’s a long night, and you’ll be staying the night at a hotel… Are you absolutely sure you’ll be okay?” “We will, mom. And we’ll be home early the day after tomorrow. I promise, we promise.” “Yes, I promise to protect your daughter, Nel.” “A-Alright… B-But call as soon as you get there! I’ll be worried if you don’t!” “Okay, we will. I love you.” “I love you too, mom.” Mother and daughter hug, we’ll only be gone for a couple of days, but Nel is hugging Hisui like she’s moving out. When she finally lets go, she hugs me. “Please make sure she doesn’t get into any trouble and take care of her.” “I will.” She finally lets go of me too and gives us one last “I love you” before we’re out the door. Me and Hisui wait until we’re out of the driveway and walking down the sidewalk to the bus stop to start talking because we have to wave to Nel the whole way out. At least, that’s what I think.

	    “God, we’re practically doing everything we said, but I feel so bad lying to mom like that.” “Lying to your mom? What are you talking about? Are we not going to the anime convention?” “O-Oh we are! B-But there is one thing that we aren’t doing…” “Hisui, I love you, but I made a promise with your mother. What you’re about to say could result in me dragging you back home.” “W-Well… I’ll tell you but only if you promise not to do that.” “Okay, I promise.” “We’re not staying at the hotel.” “Alright, I’ve heard enough.” I grab her by the waist and start bringing her home. “Hey! You promised!” “I promised I wouldn’t drag, not pick up.” “Well put me down, so I can at least explain!” “Alright.” I do, and she starts walking in the direction of the bus stop with me just standing there.
        <br><br>
	    “Hurry up, we’ll miss our bus. And I’m not telling you until we get on the bus.” I just sigh knowing that I love her too much to refuse. We wait at the bus stop for about five minutes before she gets too impatient. “I’ll tell you before we get on the bus if and only if you promise not to take me back home.” “But I still promised your mother I would protect you.” “First off, we both know that I don’t need ‘protecting.’ And second off, if it really bugs you, and that’s you not mom, we will go to the anime convention for just one day and then return back home tonight. Okay?” “Okay, I understand.” “This requires a little bit of backstory. About a year ago, I was over at Ciel’s house. I went over there to hang out, and she let me use her computer on the internet. She showed me a really cool website where I could talk about anime with people online and that was enough for me to ask mom to use hers when I got home so much that when she upgraded, I got her old one.” “Yeah, I think I remember asking about why you had a computer in your room all of a sudden.” “Well that’s the reason in case you forgot. I ended up talking with this same person a bunch and, after a while, we started talking about our personal lives more. We started emailing back and forth, just about our days or even pictures of ourselves and when I told them we were going to the anime convention, they said they would meet us there and put us up for the two nights…” 
        <br><br>
	    “I-I see…” I just think for a moment. I’m not sure if the word “stranger” would be apt here if they’ve been exchanging emails for almost a year. But I also have personally never met them, online or otherwise. But, I guess they would be considered a friend to Hisui. As a result, I really can only come to one logical conclusion. “I guess I’ll have to meet this person first.” “I knew you’d say that!” “Y-You did?” “Yep, you’re always willing to meet people before judging them! I really like that about you, Bunny!”
    </p>

    <p class="typewriter">
        “Well, it doesn’t make sense to judge beforehand. And, even if it’s only through the internet, this person you’re talking about  is a friend, right?” “Yep! You really do understand!” “Well, I’m still a bit iffy on us sleeping there but, I won’t say anything more on the matter until I meet…” “Alex!” Hisui gives me a very happy kiss on my cheek and, not long after, our bus arrives. It’s about a two-hour drive, so quite far away, but we eventually make it to the convention hall. We buy our tickets and enter the hall. 
        <br><br>
        “Wow! So many things! I-I don’t know if I’ll be able to control myself, Bunny!” “Let's just get our costumes on first, you worked hard on them, it wouldn’t feel right if we didn’t put ours on right away.” “Okay! Gotta find a bathroom! Bathroom, bathroom! Where is the bathroom?” She excitedly looks around the very, very large convention hall and, after not seeing a bathroom, she calls out to someone. “Ms. Bulma over there! You don’t happen to know where the bathrooms are?” The light-blue-haired woman smiles at Hisui’s enthusiasm and then responds. “Yes, it’s in the back over on the left side.” “Thank you! And I really like your cosplay, it’s very well done!” “Thank you! I worked really hard on it.” “Hehe, you’re very welcome. Time for me and my boyfriend to get into our cosplay hehe!” Hisui practically drags me in the direction of the bathroom, and she only gets even more excited when she looks up at the bathroom sign.
        <br><br>
        “Alright! Genderless bathroom! That means I can help you get your cosplay on!” “Thank goodness, it doesn’t have the complexity of yours, but some help would still be much appreciated.” “Hehe, let's go then!” We enter the surprisingly empty bathroom and enter a not so surprisingly empty stall. “So we’re not putting these over our normal clothes, right?” “Correct! I don’t think the mechanism for changing from Boy-Type Ranma to Girl-Type Ranma would fit if I wore my normal clothes too anyway!” We both start stripping as we continue to talk. “I’m still impressed you got that working in time, it’s simple in concept but having fans blow up and deflate empty orbs of cloth right on your chest… Very, very impressive indeed.” “Hey, you helped too. I wouldn’t have even gotten the fan motors if it weren’t for you!” “And my dad.” “Yes, and your dad. Anyway, here, help me put my binder on.” She turns away from me and hands me a piece of clothing meant to conceal her bosom. 
        <br><br>
        “Haha, this thing is like magic… Boom! Boobs gone!” “Boobs gone! I’ll put my cosplay on, and then I’ll help you with yours, Mr. Soon To Be Ryoga Hibiki!” She opens our travel bag, first taking out the “fake boob inflation device” as we’ve taken to calling it. “Okay… These straps go here, and I’ll get you to hold the switch for a second.” “Yes ma’am.” Next, she gets out her red, Chinese-style shirt to go with her Ranma Saotome cosplay. “Here, can you slide the remote wire through the sleeve?” “Yeah, here it goes… Up the sleeve!” “And on with the shirt!” “Going to test the mechanism?” “I want us to both get into our full outfits first!” “I kind of thought you would say that.” “Hehe, don’t worry. I’ve just got the pants, and then I’ll put my hair in a quick braid, and then I’ll be done and onto you!” She does just that, quickly putting on her pants and, quite impressively, putting her hair in a braid from behind without a mirror. I know she’s been practising, but she wanted to keep it a surprise so seeing her in action catches me off guard in a good way. “Okay, we’ll do your pants first since they’re the most complicated.” She takes out a very simple pair of black pants, although I know that the style of the pants themselves isn’t the complex part. I slip them on, and she gets out the string, tying it in a pattern around where the pants end. “Thanks 'Sui, I would have had a hell of a time doing this on my own, even if I was looking at the picture.” 
    </p>

    <p class="typewriter">
        “You’re very welcome!” She continues tying the string for a minute or so before finally finishing. “Okay, you can do the rest, right?” “Yep! The only thing you might have to do is to set the umbrella on the bag.” “‘Kay!” She hands me my shirt and then my black and yellow headband. Finally, she takes the umbrella out of the bag, attaches it to the top of the bag and then helps me put the whole ordeal on my back. “How do I look?” “Hmmm…” Hisui stares at me for a moment before ruffling her hand through my hair to make it a bit more messy. “Perfect! And how do I look?” “Just like Ranma!” “Hehe, let's get out of this stall, I want to look in the mirror and see if my boobs really inflate!” “Right!” We leave the stall and Hisui runs to the mirror, pressing the switch on the remote that’s up her sleeve. It’s a bit slow but the sacks of cloth on her chest inflate and her former flat chest looks bountiful. 
        <br><br>
        “Hehehehehe! It works! It really works!” “Indeed it does! Ready to finally go out there and have some fun?” “Hell yes! Just let me change back to a boy first hehe.” The switch gets pressed, and her chest slowly deflates as we walk our way out of the bathroom. “Hmm… Where do I want to go first…?” “Hold on a second, shouldn’t we be meeting your friend first?” “No, they’ve got to work today, so we’ll be meeting them tonight, and we’ll all be together for the second day!” “Okay, I guess that makes sense.” “OH! Look over there! They have figures! Let's go! Let's go!” “Ah! I’m coming! You don’t have to drag me!” As I get dragged over to a little stall that sells anime figures, I can’t help but think that getting dragged is going to be a common theme. 
        <br><br>
        “WOW! I love your guy’s cosplay!” The woman at the counter’s complement makes Hisui beam from ear to ear and Hisui’s smile makes me smile just as big. “Hehe, thank you! I made them myself!” “Wow! You’ve got yourself a very crafty girlfriend mister!” “More crafty than you might think!” She activates the device and the woman across the counter is even more impressed. “Y-You made that?” “Yep! With help gathering materials from my boyfriend of course!” “Well it’s a very impressive device.” “Thank you!” That’s how things continue. We go to different stalls around the convention and show off our costumes. It’s fun, I get to see Hisui happy, and we get to be complimented. But, it is very tiring, I’m not used to all the excitement. I feel more tired than ever as we leave the hall into the darkening Summer night, bags of tapes, figures and other things hanging from our arms.
        <br><br>
        “I’m hoping that where we’re staying is close.” “Don’t worry! It’s just down the street!” As we start our walk, I can feel myself getting nervous. I’m not the greatest with new people and the fact that we’ll be staying at this person’s house for the night doesn’t really help. Hisui though, she’s as chipper as she has been all day. Seeing her so happy alleviates my stress a little bit. We make it down the street in silence, mostly because I’m too nervous to say anything, and she’s too excited. We’re both at the peaks of our respective emotions when she stops outside of a very nice looking, painted blue home.
        <br><br>
        “S-So this is the place, huh?” “Yep! It looks much nicer in person!” *ding-dong* Hisui rings the doorbell without hesitation causing me to jump just a bit. After a moment or two, the door opens. A large man with a full beard is on the other side. He doesn’t say anything for a moment, just squinting at us. To be honest, I’m quite scared but a sense of relief washes over me when he speaks back into the house. “Alex, your friends are here.” His voice is deep but calm and quiet. “Oh! I’m coming!” We hear a high-pitched voice come closer. The person who appears is a little bit shorter than me.
