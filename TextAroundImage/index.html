            <h3>Arcueid Brunestud</h3>

            <p>
                “Yes, yes. I know mom, 10 in the morning. Arcueid’s been reminding me every day of the week.” “Just make sure you get there early, you shouldn’t keep your sister waiting.” “I won’t, I’m sure that she’ll make me drive us early. In fact, you may have some competition.” “Competition, Dear?” “Arcueid might love Kyou more than you.” “I think you underestimate the power of motherly love!” “Haha, I’m just pulling your leg, mom. Want to talk to Arcueid?” “No, it’s fine, I’ll have plenty of time to talk to her in the next few days. I’m sure you want to spend as much time as you can with her tonight before you two have to go running around and visit everyone.” “Alright, we’ll visit tomorrow with Kyou after we pick her up, but we probably won’t be staying the night for 3 or 4 days. I could over the phone how excited Kyou is to spend her first Christmas at her brother’s and his wife’s place.” “I caught that too when she called. I love you Sweetie, see you tomorrow.” “Love you too, mom. See you tomorrow. Bye.” I hang up the phone and turn off the kitchen light. I let out a big yawn and then head to the bathroom where Arcueid is, so I can get ready for bed. She’s washing her face and I wrap my arms around her from behind her, attempting to put my head on her shoulder. I quickly abandon the idea on account of my height and just rest my head on her back instead.

                “Almost done, Arc-Baby?” “Yep! And we need to go straight to bed afterwards!” “Arcueid, I doubt that we’ll sleep in until 1 no matter how late we get to bed.” “I know, but we aren’t going to wake up at 1, we should wake up at 10 at the latest, so we can have breakfast and get ready! Then we should leave at 12 for the airport!” “I know Arc, I know. We’ll get there in time, I promise. I’d never hear the end of it from mom or Kyou if we kept her waiting.” Arcueid spins around and gives me a great big peck on the lips. “I’m done washing up, all you need to do is brush your teeth, right?” “Yes, and maybe give you a few kisses in a few places when I’m done.” “Not tonight Baby! Sorry, but I absolutely want to get up in time, so I don’t want to risk it! We’ll get the chance sometime over the holidays.” “I thought so, but I can at least give you a kiss on the lips, right?” “I’ll never say no to that, Babe.” Arcueid picks me up, and I give her a kiss. She then turns around and places me in front of the sink.
                <br><br>
                “Brush your teeth, then it’s off to bed.” “Geez Arcueid, you sound like my mother.” “I don’t care who I sound like! I just want us to be prepared for tomorrow!” “I know, I’ll brush my teeth and get to bed right when I’m done, but I want something in return for going to bed so early…” “I don’t mind, you can be the little spoon tonight.” Arcueid hugs me from behind again and gives me a kiss on the cheek. “I’ll go make the bed, don’t take too long.” “I won’t. Love you Arc.” “Love you too, Baby.” I’m left on my own as I hear the pitter-patter of her slippers on our cold wood floors. I brush my teeth and, when I join Arcueid in our room, she’s already in bed with an empty spot set aside for me.
                <br><br>
                “Come on in Babe!” I do with a glimmer in my eye, I’ve never had a restless night since we’ve started sharing a bed together. I slip my wedding ring off, placing it on our nightstand, so it doesn’t get lost in our sleep and then roll over so Arcueid can put her arms around me. When she does, I feel about as half as conscious as I did before, but I’m still able to talk with her for just a bit. “I know you’re excited to see Kyou again but just remember that she’s coming right off the plane, she’s going to be tired.” “I know but Kyou’s the type of person to not even be tired after something like that!” “Haha, I suppose you’re right.
